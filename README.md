# Reddit App
Extremely early build. Expect things to be break and or not work.

## Requirements
React Native, Xcode, etc.

## Installation instructions

  1. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
  2. Build and run for iOS with `react-native run-ios`
  3. Logs with `react-native log-ios`

## TODO
  1. Ability to change subreddits and load comments reliably
  2. Currently, snoowrap is a hard dependency to do API calls to reddit, which is less than ideal
  3. Remove modules which require node environment (eg. snoowrap)
  4. Remove unnecessary boilerplate code

## Note
Build for Android has not been tested and is very low on the priority list.
