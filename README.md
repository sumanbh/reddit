# Reddit App
Extremely early build. Expect things to break and or not work.

## Requirements
React Native, Xcode, etc.

## Installation instructions

  1. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
  2. Build and run for iOS with `react-native run-ios`
  3. Logs with `react-native log-ios`

## TODO
  1. Ability to change subreddits and load comments reliably
  2. Currently, snoowrap is a hard dependency to do API calls to reddit, which is less than ideal
  3. Remove modules which require node environment (eg. snoowrap)
  4. Login, ability to upvote, submissions, etc and much more
  5. Remove unnecessary boilerplate code

## Note
Build for Android has not been tested and is very low on the priority list.
