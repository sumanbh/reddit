# Reddit App
Early build. Expect things to break.

## Requirements
React Native, Xcode, etc.

## Installation instructions

  1. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
  2. Build and run for iOS with `react-native run-ios`
  3. Logs with `react-native log-ios`

## TODO
  1. Currently, snoowrap is a hard dependency to do API calls to reddit, which is less than ideal
  2. Remove modules which require node environment (eg. snoowrap)
  3. Login, ability to upvote, submissions, etc and much more
